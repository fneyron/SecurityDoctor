# Phishing

The main idea is to redirect to a similar domain name (ie: facebo0k.com). On the web a domain similar to the true one would be required for this attack but in a local network it's way more easy. You only have to send a fake email asking the user to connect to a website (ie: facebo0k.com) once you have DNS poisonned him.
