		The deauthentication packets are sent directly from your PC to the clients. 
		So you must be physically close enough to the clients for your wireless card transmissions to reach them. 
		To confirm the client received the deauthentication packets, use tcpdump or similar to look for ACK packets back from the client. 
		If you did not get an ACK packet back, then the client did not “hear” the deauthentication packet.

	Filtre Wireshark: (wlan.ra == <client_mac>) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x001d)

	You know have the WPA Handshake in your <file>
